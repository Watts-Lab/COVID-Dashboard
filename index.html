        <h2>Data and estimations</h2>
        <p>
          These dashboards use public data from
          <a href="https://www.safegraph.com" rel="nofollow">Safegraph</a>, the
                <a href="https://www.census.gov" rel="nofollow">US Census</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org" rel="nofollow">Open Data Philly</a
          >. We do not have individual level data. All the presented statistics
          and estimates are calculated from these public data sources so we
          can't guarantee accuracy of any specific values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some analysis we provide makes assumptions about population level
          trends. For example, we estimate how many unvaccinated visitors a
          particular place is receiving by weighting the number of visitors it
          receives from each census tract by the percent of vaccinated
          individuals in that census tract. As a consequence, if someone's
          willingness to receive a vaccine predicts other differences in
          behavior our estimates would be incorrect. The data available to us
          does not allow for a more detailed analysis of these assumptions, so
          these estimates should only be interpreted as trend level insights.
        </p>
